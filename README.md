**Kheish** is an open-source, multi-role **agent** designed for complex tasks that require structured, step-by-step collaboration with Large Language Models (LLMs). Rather than a simple orchestrator, Kheish itself acts as an **intelligent agent** that can request modules on demand, integrate user feedback, switch between specialized roles (Proposer, Reviewer, Validator, Formatter, etc.), and ultimately deliver a refined result. By harnessing multiple ‚Äúsub-agents‚Äù (roles) within one framework, Kheish tackles tasks like security audits, file searches, RAG-based exploration, and more.

## Highlights of Kheish as an **Agent**

- **Adaptive Role Switching**  
  Kheish functions as a single agent with multiple internal roles:
  - **Proposer**: Generates or updates proposals based on user input and context.  
  - **Reviewer**: Critically evaluates proposals, identifying flaws or requesting improvements.  
  - **Validator**: Final gatekeeper ensuring correctness and completeness.  
  - **Formatter**: Takes a validated solution and converts it into a final presentation format (Markdown, etc.).  
  These roles can be enabled or disabled depending on the task definition in your YAML file.

- **On-Demand Module Requests**  
  As an agent, Kheish can spontaneously invoke modules if it needs more information or functionality. Modules include:  
  - **Filesystem (`fs`)**: Reading files chunk by chunk, indexing them in RAG.  
  - **Shell (`sh`)**: Running limited shell commands with sandboxed allowances.  
  - **RAG (`rag`)**: Storing and retrieving large amounts of text via embeddings, enabling chunk-based queries.  
  - **SSH (`ssh`)**: Secure remote commands.  
  - **Memories (`memories`)**: Storing or recalling data outside the immediate LLM context (long-term memory).

- **Feedback & Iteration**  
  In many tasks, Kheish re-checks and revises its own proposals. For example:
  1. **Proposer** suggests a solution.
  2. **Reviewer** critiques and possibly requests changes.
  3. **Proposer** refines based on feedback.
  4. **Validator** delivers final approval or requests more fixes.  
  This iterative approach provides an agent that grows the solution‚Äôs quality step by step.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
  For large codebases or multi-file contexts, Kheish indexes data in a vector store. It can retrieve relevant snippets later without stuffing the entire text into a single LLM prompt. This agent-based RAG integration reduces token usage and scales to bigger projects.

- **Single Agent, Many Tasks**  
  Kheish can handle parallel or serial tasks by defining separate YAML configurations or combining them into a single multi-step scenario. Each role or module request is orchestrated **internally** by Kheish‚Äôs logic‚Äîno external orchestrator needed.

### Legacy Examples
| Task Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `audit-code` | Security audit of codebases with vulnerability detection |
| `hf-secret-finder` | Hugging Face repository secret detection |
| `find-in-file` | Multi-file secret searching with chunk processing |
| `weather-blog-post` | Weather API integration with creative content generation |

## Quick Start

1. **Set up your API key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

2. **Build Kheish**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run a comprehensive demo**:
   ```bash
   # Smart Code Assistant (recommended first demo)
   ./target/release/kheish --task-config examples/tasks/smart-code-assistant/task.yaml
   
   # Digital Detective  
   ./target/release/kheish --task-config examples/tasks/digital-detective/task.yaml
   
   # Learning Assistant
   ./target/release/kheish --task-config examples/tasks/learning-assistant/task.yaml
   ```

4. **View results**: Check the `exports/` directory for generated reports

5. **Explore more**: See `examples/tasks/README.md` for detailed demo documentation

## Example Tasks

| Task Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `audit-code` | A thorough security audit of a codebase, identifying potential vulnerabilities via multi-step agent roles. |
| `hf-secret-finder` | Requests the Hugging Face API, clones the repositories, and uses `trufflehog` (via the `sh` module) to detect secrets. |
| `find-in-file` | Searches for a secret across multiple files, chunk-reading them with `fs`. |
| `weather-blog-post` | Fetches live weather data (via `web` or a custom module) and writes a humorous blog post about it. |

## How Kheish Works

1. **Reads a YAML Configuration**  
   Includes the agent roles, modules, the workflow of steps, and final output instructions.
2. **Builds an Agent**  
   Kheish loads the roles (Proposer, Reviewer, etc.) and hooks in the modules for possible requests.  
3. **Executes Steps Internally**  
   The agent:
   - Gathers context (files, text).
   - Generates or refines a solution (`Proposer`).
   - Seeks feedback (`Reviewer`) if needed.
   - Validates correctness (`Validator`).
   - Formats the final result (`Formatter`).
4. **Optional RAG Integration**  
   If large data is encountered, the agent chunk-indexes it into a vector store, retrieving relevant pieces via semantic queries.
5. **API Integration**
   Kheish provides a REST API that allows:
   - Task submission and monitoring
   - Real-time status updates
   - Result retrieval
   - Module execution control
6. **Output**  
   Once validated, Kheish saves or exports the final solution. If further feedback is provided, it can loop back into revision mode automatically.

## Installation & Usage
